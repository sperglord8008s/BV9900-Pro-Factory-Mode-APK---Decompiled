# Blackview-BV9900-Pro-Factory-Mode-APK-FLIR-Test--Decompiled
Blackview BV9900 Pro Factory Mode APK (hardware test Thermal Test Flir Test etc) - Decompiled


This is the Decompiled app to "Test" the flir sensor for the Blackview BV9900 Pro
The reason i went to the effort to extract this is because the original FLir app has a worse resolution then the test program
infact the flir app actually crops the Lepton 2 80×60 (17 µm) sensor to fit the low megapixel visual camera, Absurd! 
it also soften's the picture which i find useless tbh.
